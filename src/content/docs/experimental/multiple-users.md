title: Multiple users
---

## Why this is experimental

Jakeloud is ment to be mainly used for production.
Having multiple users means less opacity and less stability.
It is always easier to consider one person an admin and solely rely on him.

However, at some point in time, you may want to add collaborators to your project as it grows.

## How to enable this feature

Tick checkbox `Registration allowed` in Jakeloud app settings.

![settings panel](@/assets/settings-panel.png)

:::danger

This will allow anyone to register. So make sure to switch it back, once you're done.

## What can other users do

Owner of the Jakeloud app is the admin. Only admin can change global settings of Jakeloud.

All users have access to all projects, can delete them, update and create new ones.
