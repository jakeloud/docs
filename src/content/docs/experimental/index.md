## Why those features are experimental

Jakeloud is my personal project, so I'm always seeking new ways to improve it.
As you may understand, some of my ideas don't line up with simplicity and stability.
As a result I'd like to keep core features of Jakeloud pretty minimal and **bugless**.
That's why everything that is not required to run production app is considered experimental for now.

After this disclaimer, you can safely proceed :-)
